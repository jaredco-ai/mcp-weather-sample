# ðŸŒ¦ MCP Weather Tool for n8n (Demo Workflow)

This repo provides a **ready-to-use n8n workflow** that connects to a hosted [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.org/) server for weather forecasts.

---

## ðŸš€ What This Is

- A working example of how to call a **custom MCP tool** from n8n
- The tool fetches **current or 3-day weather forecasts**
- Hosted MCP endpoint:  
  ðŸ‘‰ https://mcp-weathertrax.jaredco.com/call-tool

This demo uses the **MCP Agent node** in n8n to send tool calls to the server.
